In this project, we have designed and implemented an IoT-enabled smart home using an IoT analytics platform service ThingSpeak and Matlab as our main tools. We have aggregated, visualized, and analyzed live data streams of data from sensors using Arduino, ThingSpeak, and Matlab. We have used two sensors to collect temperature, humidity, and UV index from the surrounding. We have used Arduino MKR 1010 board to read data from sensors and to send this data to the ThingSpeak channel. We have used ThingSpeak application React, Matlab analysis, and time control to execute the actions in different conditions.
